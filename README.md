Important Information:

For this code NPM was used aswell as hidden node_modules and a hidden dist folder.

This should help you just by seeing and, if you want, using the public folder, to understand the used code.

Everything else is not important.

If you are using Stackblitz, the public file should be enough.

If you are using VSCode, hit me up and we can talk.
